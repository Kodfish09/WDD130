    <h3>[Attractions]</h3>
    <h4>Dog Park</h4>
    <p>
      Our Dog Park is the only one of it’s kind in the world. Instead of bringing a dog to run around in a park, we provide dogs for anyone who might want to spend some quality time with man’s best friend. Just bring yourself and we’ll supply everything else! From chew toys, to tennis balls, to doggy treats. Chill out with a chihuahua, hang out with a husky, or even dance with a Great Dane! Specific breeds available at your visit may vary. We do not explicitly guarantee you will see any specific breed at any given time. 
    </p>
    <h4>Ultimate Hide and Go Seek</h4>
    <p>
      It may surprise you to learn the kinds of things that endless rabbits can fuel. It sure surprised us when one day we ended up with a state-of-the-art hide-and-go-seek arena with enough false doors, secret tunnels, and hidden nooks to satisfy anyone! Now we rent out this fantastic space for every kind of event imaginable! From Billy’s birthday party to professional hide-and-go-seek teams from around the world! Book access to our unique space today! 
    </p>
    <h4>Eagle Eye View</h4>
    <p>
      One of our most popular attractions is our Eagle Eye View hot air balloon. From this vantage point look down on all Sunny Acres’ many attractions! Eagle Eye has been giving aerial tours to people for 20 years and is still going strong! Make sure to stop by this amazing attraction the first chance you get! 
    </p>
    <h4>Ye Olde Pye Shop</h4>
    <p>
      The Ye Olde Pye Shop is a medieval themed pie shop that sells pies of all shapes and sizes! However, while we sell many kinds of pie, our specialty is rabbit meat pies! At this one stop pie shop you can have an egg and sausage pie for breakfast, a cheesy macaroni pie for lunch, and a potato and steak pie for dinner. Wrap it all up with a delicious chocolate pie for dessert. If you’re hungry we’ve got a pie for you. 
    </p>
    <h4>Petting Zoo</h4>
    <p>
      What kind of rabbit farm would we be without a good petting zoo? Not much of one is the answer! Our petting farm is easily one of our most popular attractions and it’s easy to understand why! Not only do we have goats, donkeys, chickens, and alpacas but we also have rabbits of all shapes and sizes! From Angora rabbits with their fluffy fur to Highland Hares with their strong bodies we’ve got them all! 
    </p>
    <h4>Entree?</h4>
    <p>One thing that differentiates us from every other petting zoo on the planet is our unique view on food! At other petting zoos they let you feed the animals. At our petting zoo the animals can feed you! For the right price any animal you can catch will be your next meal! Just give our world class chefs some time with your catch and we’ll present it to you as a delicious entrée.</p>

    <h3>[About Us]</h3>
    <h4>Basic Intro</h4>
    <p>Sunny Acres is a terrific and innovative farm filled with all kinds of interesting things. Our unique mode of animal care ensures our rabbits spend their lives as close to bunny heaven as can be imagined while also providing plenty of fertilizer to ensure our plants get everything they could ever want. </p>
    <h4>The Bunny Fuel</h4>
    <p>How we maintain our operations here are Sunny Acres is very simple. We receive free access to 365 days of sunshine. Using that sunshine, we grow grass in each of our many pastures. Then we allow our rabbits to eat the grass! Because rabbits multiply so fast as long as we keep the sun shining and the grass growing, we have a near endless source of rabbits to use for anything we might need! We have an endless source of meat and furs which we either sell or eat to fuel all the rest of our endeavors here at Sunny Acres. </p>

                        <p>What kind of rabbit farm would we be without a good petting zoo? Not much of one is the answer! Our petting farm is easily one of our most popular attractions and it’s easy to understand why! Not only do we have goats, donkeys, chickens, and alpacas but we also have rabbits of all shapes and sizes! From Angora rabbits with their fluffy fur to Highland Hares with their strong bodies we’ve got them all!</p>

At this one stop pie shop you can have an egg and sausage pie for breakfast, a cheesy macaroni pie for lunch, and a potato and steak pie for dinner. Wrap it all up with a delicious chocolate pie for dessert. If you’re hungry we’ve got a pie for you.</p>

                        <p>One thing that differentiates us from every other petting zoo on the planet is our unique view on food! At other petting zoos they let you feed the animals. At our petting zoo the animals can feed you! For the right price any animal you can catch will be your next meal! Just give our world class chefs some time with your catch and we’ll present it to you as a delicious entrée.</p>
